## Peer Evaluation: Info301 Week7 Presentation

Based on the insightful peer evaluations, we have identified specific areas to improve and enhance our project. Here is a detailed plan of action, structured around actionable suggestions:

### **1. Methodology and Interpretation Enhancements**
- **Detailed Methodology Explanation:**
  - **Action:** Create a flowchart or schematic outlining the data pipeline, including preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning training, and validation steps. This will clarify processes for Figures 3, 4, and the feature importance plot.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Include a step-by-step explanation of how the word networks were constructed” (Farhan Arshad).*  
  - *“Include a detailed section or flowchart that outlines the machine learning process” (Rabin Mahatara).*  

- **Cluster and Feature Importance Interpretation:**
  - **Action:** Add annotations to explain key features in the importance plot and interpret network clusters in the context of misinformation detection. Use examples from data to show implications of patterns (e.g., SUPPORTS vs. REFUTES claims).
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Provide more context on how to interpret the clusters” (Farhan Arshad);* *“Add concise legends or annotations to the network graph” (Danrong Zhou).*

---

### **2. Visualization Improvements**
- **Figure Accessibility and Clarity:**
  - **Action:** Ensure all figures include clear legends, captions, and larger, readable font sizes. Use contrasting colors to improve clarity in network graphs and maps.  
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Ensure all labels and text are easily readable” (Munkh-Orshikh Munkhbold);* *“The network graph could benefit from clearer legends or annotations” (Yi'an Pei).*

- **Simplify Visualizations:**
  - **Action:** Filter less significant nodes in network graphs and consider alternate layouts (e.g., circular or hierarchical). Highlight important nodes and edges using a consistent color palette.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Simplify the network graph by filtering out less significant nodes” (Yijia Sun);* *“Simplify these visualizations by highlighting key features” (Rabin Mahatara).*

---

### **3. Discussion and Conclusion Section**
- **Summarize Findings and Recommendations:**
  - **Action:** Include a discussion/conclusion section that synthesizes key findings and proposes actionable strategies for combating misinformation. Link these insights directly to visualizations to enhance relevance for policymakers.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Include a discussion/conclusion section to talk about some general ideas or the summary” (Xiaoyi Kuang);* *“Strengthen the conclusion with specific policy recommendations” (Yi'an Pei).*

---

### **4. Interactivity and Advanced Tools**
- **Interactive Visualizations:**
  - **Action:** Add tooltips or dynamic filtering options to allow users to explore nodes and relationships interactively. Use D3.js or similar tools to improve user engagement.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Consider adding interactivity to the network graph” (Yi'an Pei);* *“Incorporate dynamic network visualizations” (Peng Wang).*

- **Temporal and Predictive Dimensions:**
  - **Action:** Explore temporal visualizations to track misinformation spread over time. Integrate predictive analytics to forecast high-risk regions based on demographic and cultural factors.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Incorporate a temporal dimension” (Yifei Wang);* *“Add predictive modeling to anticipate high-risk regions” (Shouzhifan Zhu).*

---

### **5. Accessibility and Audience Engagement**
- **Glossary and Demonstrations:**
  - **Action:** Add a glossary to explain technical terms (e.g., “modularity analysis”) and prepare a step-by-step guide to using interactive features.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Simplify terminology and add explanations for non-expert audiences” (Shouzhifan Zhu);* *“Include a short demonstration or step-by-step guide” (Yijia Sun).*

---

### **6. Interdisciplinary Integration**
- **Collaborations for Deeper Insights:**
  - **Action:** Engage with cognitive psychologists and sociologists to analyze behavioral aspects of misinformation. Incorporate cultural frameworks (e.g., Hofstede’s dimensions) to link data to cultural patterns.
  - **Comment Reference:** *“Collaborate with psychologists to explore behavioral aspects” (Danrong Zhou);* *“Provide a focused analysis of cultural dimensions” (Shouzhifan Zhu).*

### **Next Steps**
We will implement these suggestions systematically, prioritizing methodology clarity and figure accessibility. As we refine our visualizations, we aim to ensure they are not only visually engaging but also insightful, actionable, and accessible for diverse audiences. Thank you for the constructive feedback!
